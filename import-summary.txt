ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project OpenCV Library - @OPENCV_VERSION@:C:\Users\Jonathan\Downloads\OpenCV Try
   3\opencv\sources\modules\java\android_sdk\android_lib\.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project OpenCV Library -
   @OPENCV_VERSION@: ignored. The project may not compile if the given source
   path provided source code.


Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => openCVLibraryOPENCV_VERSION\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* lint.xml => openCVLibraryOPENCV_VERSION\lint.xml
* res\ => openCVLibraryOPENCV_VERSION\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
